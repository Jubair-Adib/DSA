Given an array representation of a complete binary tree, 
where the root node is stored at index 0, 
and for any node at index i, its left child is located at index 2i + 1 and its right child at index 2i + 2, 

develop an efficient algorithm to perform an inorder traversal of the binary tree without explicitly reconstructing the tree structure.

The algorithm should return a list of elements in the inorder sequence, where "inorder" is defined as visiting the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
